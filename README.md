# OpenGL Platformer
A simple platformer game in C++.
I've written two versions of the game; one in SDL2, and the other is in GLUT.

# Compilation
Just run `COMPILE.bat`. Remember to change the `-I` and `-L` compiler/linker options if they don't lead to the `Include`/`Lib` directory of SDL or FreeGLUT.
